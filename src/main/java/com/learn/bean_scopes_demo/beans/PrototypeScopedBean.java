/**
 * Prototype-scoped beans are created as new instances each time they are requested(I assume this is not http request) from the
 * Spring container, making them useful for managing state that should not be shared across
 * requests.
 *
 * In this example, the PrototypeScopedBean class has a unique instanceId that is set during bean initialization.
 * Every time the bean is requested, a new instance with a unique ID is created.
 *
 * The @Scope("prototype") annotation ensures that a new instance of PrototypeScopedBean is created every
 * time itâ€™s requested from the #### Spring context ####.
 *
 * This setup is useful when you need a fresh instance of a bean for each request or operation,
 * such as for objects that handle request-specific data, temporary calculations, or processing-specific tasks.
 *
